## 📰 Introduction

The **Global News App** is a simple and user-friendly web application that fetches the latest news from different countries in real time.

It uses the World News API to gather articles and then presents them to the user in a clean and organized layout.

What the App Does:

- Allows users to choose from 10 different countries using a dropdown menu.

- Automatically updates the language of the news based on the selected country.

- Shows the current date and time at the top of the app.

- Displays each news article as a card, including:

  - 🖼️ Thumbnail Image

  - 🏷️ News Title
